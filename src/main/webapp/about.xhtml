                <b>Transcription factors</b>, in a somewhat simplified definition, are
                proteins that regulate transcription by binding to specific sequence
                elements in regulatory genome regions such as promoters, enhancers etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>TFClass</b> is a classification of eukaryotic transcription factors
                based on the characteristics of their DNA-binding domains. It comprises
                four general levels (superclass, class, family, subfamily) and two
                levels of instantiation (genus and molecular species). Two of them
                (subfamily and factor species) are optional. More detailed explanations
                about the classification scheme and its criteria are given
                <a href="http://www.edgar-wingender.de/TFClass_schema.html" target="_blank">here.</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, TFClass comprises human transcription factors (TFs) and their
                rodent orthologs. The full classification of human TFs in its latest draft
                version as html document can also be obtained
                <a href="http://www.edgar-wingender.de/huTF_classification.html" target="_blank">here</a>,
                that of their mouse orthologs

            <h2>About the interface:</h2>
            <p>
                The active ontology is shown in the central part (default: human), it can
                be <span class="function_ref">switched</span> with the one on the right-hand side (default: mouse). To
                browse the classification, an individual taxon can be opened by clicking
                on the arrow head in front of it; clicking again closes all taxa that may
                have been opened. The classification of orthologs on the right-hand side
                opens correspondingly.
            </p><p>
                On the left-hand side, further <span class="function_ref">search and browse functions</span> as well
                as <span class="function_ref">additional information</span> for the highlighted taxon in the central
                part are provided. The <span class="function_ref">search field</span> is equipped with an autocomplete
                function to facilitate finding the right term among all the conceivable
                spelling variations. <span class="function_ref">Expand / collapse all:</span> expands the full tree in
                the center or collapses all parts of the tree that have been opened.
                <span class="function_ref">Expand to:</span> The whole classification in the center will be opened
                down to the selected level.
            </p><p>
                The additional information is rank- and organism-specific and
                changes with the selection made.
            </p><p>
                <span class="function_ref">Show binding sites:</span> Linked to (sub)family entities, if present.
                Clicking this option will open a selection list of all matrices
                that are connected with any of the TFs in this (sub)family.
                Chosing one of them will open the complete list of potential
                binding sites that (a) are located in the 1kb upstream region of
                human genes, (b) are conserved among human, mouse, dog and cow,
                and (c) have a minimum threshold as selected. Most database
                cross-references: Linked to TF genus entries (rank 5); links to
                external databases go straight to their entries. Links to

                isoforms and TRANSFAC proteins are also given for individual
                factor species.
